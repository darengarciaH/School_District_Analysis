# School_District_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this School District Analysis is to introduce a scenario that would alter our data analysis performed on the School District data: academic dishonesty amongst 9th graders from Thomas High School, a very particular cohort. As instructed by our supervisors, we are to remove math and reading scores for all 9th graders from Thomas High School and replace them with null values (NaN) so they will not figure into our calculations. Our responsibility is to determine how this will affect our District Summary and School Summary data.
## Results
While this academic dishonesty scandal from this cohort of 9th graders from Thomas High School directly affects scores for Thomas High School when reviewing our School Summary, it clearly will not affect scores from other schools.
